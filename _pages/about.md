I am a **Research Fellow** (RamÃ³n y Cajal RYC2020-030777-I) at the [Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/) and a member of the [Computer Vision Center (CVC)](https://www.cvc.uab.es/). My work lies at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and responsible AI.

Currently, my research explores how to detect and mitigate algorithmic bias in multimodal AI systems, and how to address privacy and ethical concerns in deep learning algorithms. I am also involved in applying computer vision techniques to the analysis and preservation of cultural heritage assets.

Earlier in my career, I was a TECNIOspring Research Fellow (2018â€“2020), a program co-funded by the European Commission under the Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Actions. I've held research stays at the [Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC)](https://www.micc.unifi.it/) in Florence (Italy) and the [Intelligent Media Processing Group](http://imlab.jp/index-e.html) in Osaka (Japan). I've been also an active contributor to the [ICDAR Robust Reading Competitions](http://rrc.cvc.uab.es/), a community benchmarking initiative for text understanding in images.

In parallel to my academic path, I have a strong interest in the social implications of AI and in making deep learning models more fair and interpretable.
